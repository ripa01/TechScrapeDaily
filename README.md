# TechScrapeDaily

**TechScrapeDaily** website is designed to provide you with the latest tech news from The Daily Star using web scraping techniques. I use BeautifulSoup for scraping, Flask for the web framework, and HTML/CSS for the frontend. You can view the scraped data on the website and even take screenshots of the pages if necessary.
